The following files are provided in order to make reproducible the analysis developed:
- *models_code.R*: It is a script which contains all the modeling approaches developed in the research article. Note that for running the analysis is needed the data input.
- *modelingSpData.csv* is a subset of the HYs dataset used for modeling. The information provide in this file is:
	prec: precipitation value of each territorial unit;
	hfp: human footprint value of each territorial unit;
	forest: percentage of forest cover of each territorial unit;
	bioreg: the bioreg that each territorial unit corresponds to;
	Var1: x centroid coordinates in kilometers; 
	Var2: y centroid coordinates in kilometers;
	Ss: HYs data for Sus scrofa;
	Ce: HYs data for Cervus elaphus;
	Cc: HYs data for Capreolus capreolus;
	Vv: HYs data for Vulpes vulpes.
